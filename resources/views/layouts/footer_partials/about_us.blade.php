            <hr/>
            <p >Bangladesh has achieved quite phenomenal success in the RMG sector over the last 3-4 decades. However, we found that there still exists some gap between buyers and suppliers of RMG and related sectors and subsectors. We want to create a common platform for every organization and individual involved in the vast RMG and related sector; where all the individuals or organizations involved in any RMG related business, the buyers and sellers, can easily communicate and connect with each other, conveniently.</p>
